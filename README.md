# Marketplace-Sales-Report

**Project Overview:
Mobile Phone Sales on an E-commerce Platform**
This is an integrated dashboard that uses **_SQL_** to extract data from large datasets hosted on SSMS. This proves as an **_effective way_** of handling large datasets with ****frequent refresh intervals****. 

This integrated view illustrates a **_macro-level_** view of some of the top products and their sales on an e-commerece marketplace for over 5 years starting from 2019. 

Created on Power BI, it uses **_Direct Query mode_** to extract relevant tables from the database managed on SSMS and **_Import Mode_** to query a few data points required to create **_KPIs and interactive visuals_**.
